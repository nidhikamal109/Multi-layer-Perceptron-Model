# Multi-layer-Perceptron-Model
This notebook is for understanding the multi-layer perceptron neural network. I have used the titanic dataset where the goal is to predict the passengers who survived the titanic shipwreck. It is a classification problem.

Following is the link for this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data
